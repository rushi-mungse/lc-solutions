## This is blog 1

<div>
  This Friday evening will begin the holiday of Sukkot. It is a multifaceted
  holiday that connects us to the environment, to our history and heritage, and
  to the joy of our spiritual tradition. It's known as Chag HaAssif, the Harvest
  Festival, because it's celebrated during autumn (in the Northern Hemisphere),
  which is the time of year in Israel when the final harvest is brought in from
  the fields. In ancient times, farmers would build Sukkot in their fields
  during the harvest to maximize the time they put into completing the harvest.
  The Sukkahs we build for the holiday also remind us of the temporary dwellings
  our ancestors lived in during the 40 years that we wandered in the Sinai
  desert following our liberation from slavery in Egypt. Traditionally, we eat
  our meals in the Sukkah, and there are some who even sleep in their Sukkahs.
  There's just something special about eating outdoors, which connects us to
  nature in ways that we may have simply lost touch with over the course of our
  busy lives. This is another possible reason why Sukkot is referred to in our
  liturgy as Z'man Simchateinu, the Season of our Joy. About Sukkot, the Torah
  says:

## Whoever did not see

- Water was never offered on the Altar of the Beit HaMikdash (the Holy Temple) except during Sukkot at the Simchat Beit HaShoeivah. Great ceremony was associated with it. In the morning, water would be drawn from the Pool of Shiloach (בְּרֵכַת הַשִּׁילוֹחַ - where Hezekiah’s tunnel begins in Jerusalem today). The water was brought to the Temple from the Spring amid fanfare and music, where the Kohanim offered it on the Altar of the Holy Temple along with wine and the other sacrifices of the day.

`Interestingly, for Passover, Shavuot, and Rosh HaShanah, it is the world that is judged. On Sukkot, when it comes to water, the Talmud says, “They” are judged.`
