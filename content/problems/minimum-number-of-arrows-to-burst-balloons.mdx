# Description

<div className="mt-4 text-md">
  There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the
  XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array `points` where
  `points[i] = [xstart, xend]` denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter
  stretches between `xstart` and `xend`. You do not know the exact y-coordinates
  of the balloons.
</div>

<div className="mt-4 text-md">
 Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with `xstart` and `xend` is burst by an arrow shot at x if `xstart <= x <= xend`. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.
</div>

<div className="mt-4 text-md">
  Given the array `points`, return the minimum number of arrows that must be
  shot to burst all balloons.
</div>

# Example

<div className="mt-2 flex flex-col">
  <span className="mr-4"> Input </span>
  <span className="text-muted-foreground text-sm ml-2">
    points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
  </span>
</div>

<div className="mt-2 flex flex-col">
  <span className="mr-4"> Output </span>
  <span className="text-muted-foreground text-sm ml-2">2</span>
</div>

<div className="mt-2 flex flex-col">
  <span className="mr-4"> Explanation</span>
  <span className="text-muted-foreground text-sm ml-2">
    The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
    <li> Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6]. </li>
    <li>Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12] </li>
  </span>
</div>

# Intuition

- There are several `segments` on the one-dimensional coordinate axis, find out the `minimum` number of arrows which are orthogonal to the coordinate axis so that each segment can be shot through by at least one `arrow`.

# Approaches

## Using Sorting

- Given points
  <img src="/452/points.png" alt="aalysis" className="mt-4 mb-4" />
- Sort the segments by the end

  <img src="/452/sort-points.png" alt="sort-points" className="mt-4 mb-4" />

  ```cpp
   sort(points.begin(), points.end(), [&](auto &x, auto &y) {
      return x[1] < y[1];
    });
  ```

- Put an arrow at the end of the `1-st` segment
  <img src="/452/first-arrow.png" alt="first-arrow" className="mt-4 mb-4" />
- From the `2-nd` segment, we check whether the current arrow pass through the current `segment`, if not add an arrow, put it at the end of the current segment
  <img src="/452/second-arrow.png" alt="second-arrow" className="mt-4 mb-4" />

### Time Complexity

- `O(N * log(N))` where 'N' is points length

### Space Complexity

- `O(1)`

### Code

```cpp title="cpp"
class Solution {
public:
  int findMinArrowShots(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
    sort(points.begin(), points.end(), [&](auto &x, auto &y) {
      return x[1] < y[1];
    });

    int n = points.size(), ans = 1, max = points[0][1];

    for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      if(points[i][0] > max) {
        ans++;
        max = points[i][1];
      }
    }

    return ans;
  }
};
```
